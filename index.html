  	<h1>How Gillian Anderson helped shape Agent Scully's character</h1>
  	<h6>CBC Archives · Posted: Aug 09, 2018 11:38 AM ET | Last Updated: August 9, 2018</h6>
  	<h2>The X-Files star describes how Dana Scully was developed from the start<br></h2>
  	<p><em>The X-Files</em> is a show that is built on secrets.</p>
    <p>One such secret revealed to CBC viewers in 1995 was the story behind Agent Dana Scully's personal style.</p>
    <p>As actor Gillian Anderson told CBC's <em>Midday</em>, she wore an outfit to her audition for the series that somehow informed her take on the character.</p>
    <h3>'Somewhat frumpy'</h3>
    <p>"I borrowed a suit from a friend of mine … she looked very good in oversized suits and clothes," said Anderson, who turns 50 on August 9.</p>
    <p>"So, I walked into the first audition for <em>The X-Files</em> in a very oversized suit and looked somewhat frumpy in that way."</p>
    <p>Anderson said that the show's creator, Chris Carter, saw something in her that made him feel like she was speaking to the character he had written.</p>
    <p>"He really pushed for me to have the role," Anderson said.</p>
    <h3>A 'deadpan' style?</h3>
    <p>The Scully character, as all X-Files fans will know, is the sensible, scientific foil to her partner on the show — Agent Fox Mulder, who was played by David Duchovny.</p>
    <p>Both actors would play the characters across 11 seasons of the Vancouver-shot show, as well as two big-screen outings as Mulder and Scully.</p>
    <p>Asked about the "deadpan" style of communication between the two series leads, Anderson said it was all in the scripts.</p>
    <p>"Chris Carter, from the beginning, has had a very strong perception of who these characters are and he has a very specific formula that he wants us to keep to," she said.</p>
    <p>"And he never really talked about a deadpan nature between the two of us and David and I certainly never had discussions about that specifically."</p>
    <p>She did offer an alternate theory — that sometimes she and Duchovny were simply tired from filming the show and that's how the dialogue came across.</p>
    <h3>Is the real-life Scully a 'believer'?</h3>
    <p>In spite of playing the skeptic, Anderson herself claims to be a little bit of a "believer," when prodded by <em>Midday</em> co-host Brent Bambury to talk about an experience in her personal life. </p>
    <p>When speaking with <em>Midday</em>, she described a "strange feeling" that she had after moving into a house in Vancouver, and how she called on help to "cleanse the house of anything that might be lingering from the past." Which fortunately, for <em>X-Files</em> fans, seemed to work.  </p>
